# Product Guidelines - OpenInsight

## Visual Identity & Design Philosophy
OpenInsight adheres to the principle of **Epistemic Minimalism**. The interface must be a silent partner in the user's reading experience, never a distraction.
*   **Minimalist UI:** The interface should be ultra-clean and distraction-free, utilizing high contrast and exceptionally readable typography.
*   **Functional Aesthetics:** Use a limited color palette of neutral tones, reserving color only for functional accents (e.g., status indicators, primary buttons).
*   **Spacial Clarity:** Leverage whitespace aggressively to separate the content being explained/checked from the extension's UI, ensuring the user's focus remains on the information.

## Content & Voice
The tone of OpenInsight's output is a core part of its utility and is user-configurable to match their preference:
*   **Configurable Tone:** Users can choose between "Objective/Neutral" (strictly factual), "Conversational" (authoritative but approachable), or "Concise" (direct and minimal).
*   **Clarity Above All:** Regardless of the selected tone, the output must prioritize clarity and truth, avoiding jargon and unnecessary fluff.

## User Experience & Interaction
*   **Seamless Integration:** The pop-up must appear and disappear fluidly, minimizing friction in the reading process.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Provide subtle, minimalist progress indicators during data retrieval to keep the user informed without cluttering the screen.
*   **Distinct Output:** Visually distinguish between "Explain" and "Fact-check" results to provide immediate context for the information being presented.
*   **Utility Features:** Include unobtrusive options for users to copy or share the insights generated by the extension.
