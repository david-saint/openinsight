# Initial Concept

A chrome extension called "OpenInsight". It functions by attaching a pop-up to user's highlighted sentence allowing them to either explain the highlighted sentence (default behavior) or fact-check the sentence. It would be using the design philosophy "epistemic minimalism", stripping away the clutter of other tools, focussinginstead on clarity and truth. it would also be customizable by allowing the users to change the theme as well as choose the language models used for explaining and fact checking. They'll need to provide their openrouter api key. It would also need to be very secure. it'll store the key locally and should be sandboxed to prevent malicious people from accessing the key.
